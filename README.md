# KOllama

A Kotlin-first library for [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), providing idiomatic Kotlin APIs to interact with Ollama's
server.

> 🚧 **Development Status**: We're actively building core features. The API is stable but may evolve.  
> 📚 **Documentation**: Code is thoroughly documented with KDoc. We plan to set up CI to auto-generate Dokka
> documentation soon.  
> 📦 **Distribution**: Not yet published to Maven Central. For now, use JitPack (see below).

## Features

- ✅ Full support for Ollama API: generate, chat, pull, push, list, etc.
- ✅ Coroutines & Flow for streaming responses
- ✅ Type-safe requests and responses with `kotlinx.serialization`
- ✅ Built on Ktor client (engine-swappable)

## Installation (via JitPack)

Add the JitPack repository and dependency:

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts or build.gradle.kts
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.BlophyNova:kollama:main-SNAPSHOT") // or a specific commit hash
}
```

Quick Start

Here's a simple example to generate text:

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
    val ollama = KOllamaClient()
    val r = ollama.chat {
        model = "qwen3-vl:latest"
        message {
            role = ChatRole.User
            content = "What is the meaning of life?"
        }
        stream = false
    }
    println(r.message.content)
}
```

For chat, pulling models, etc., check the KDoc in the code.

Documentation

Currently, the best documentation is the KDoc in the source code. We encourage you to explore the code or use your IDE
to view the docs. In the future, we will host Dokka-generated documentation online.
